# LinuxBackup_Rust

This is just for me to learn Rust and overall get better with programming while experimenting.
With that in mind, I have a bit of a plan for this project and where I want it to go.

  1. Get Bash commands executed in Rust (0%)
  2. Make a copy of some files, such as Downloads, Documents, config files, etc and put them all into a compressed file (either .gz or .tar) (0%)
  3. Make a versioning/dating scheme so that I can backup and restore without it being outdated or it not existing. (0%)
  4. Have it upload to GitHub (for file server, see Extra #2 below) 
  <br>

  Extra #1: Have a service running to get package list and files of other PC running rather than backing everything up and going the long way. 
  <br>
  Extra #2: Have it upload to my file server for easier management and faster restoration processes.
  <br>
  Extra #3: Have it remove outdated versions or create a manager in Rust (or even GTK3/Qt5) to manage them.
  <br>
  
  This will be interesting to make, so time for me to commit to this.
